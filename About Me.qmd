Hello!

I'm Benny, a third-year undergraduate student at the University of Toronto, St. George Campus. I am enrolled in the Chemical Physics Specialist, Statistics Minor, and Mathematics Minor programs. I also have over 7 years of mathematics, physics, and chemistry tutoring experience, both volunteer-based and professional, at the high school and university level. Further, I have been involved in leading an organization to help prepare Grade 12 students in Toronto for university as well as a political advocacy group.
